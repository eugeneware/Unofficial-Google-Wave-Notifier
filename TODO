= TODO
== Instruction for releasing new version
0. Commit (and push, if you like,) task level modification before bump up to new version.
1. Modify "Bundle version" in the Info.plist and CHANGELOG (maybe TODO too).
2. Do `make zip appcast VERSION=X.X` and paste XML snipet into Sparkle/appcast.xml.
(You should remove not published appcast item)
3. Upload the zip archive to github and notify the new version as a RC (and wait a day or two).
4. Commit with message "Bumped up to X.X" and `git tag X.X`

5. If you get a bug report, fix it and get back to '0' with incremented tiny version number (e.g. X.X.1)
6. If you feel OK, do `git push master X.X[.X]` (publish Sparkle/appcast.xml)
7. Test "Check for update"


== 0.6?
* preferences: alternative browser setting to default one (maybe Safari) for opening InBox and unread waves [#3]


== Small bugs
* unread waves menu items doesn't refresh at an error

== Someday/maybe features
* don't count currently editing wave by the user self as an unread

* checking for online members
* contains participant names in a title of unread item

* annoyance: avoid freezing while checking status against wave.google.com inspite of useing NSTimer. Need to use thread?

* add link to CHANGELOG and Downloads on github beside version number in the preferences window

* give some infomation with Tooltip
* ignore filter for waves (and users)
* preferences: interval time for check (should limit minimum of 5 min)
* preferences: alternative option for the number displayed at status bar (number of unread blips or unread waves)

* ESC key to close preferences window

== Needed, but blocked
* OAuth for not hundling your password (If I find a way to use OAuth for wave.google.com)
